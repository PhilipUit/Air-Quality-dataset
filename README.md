Notice how there are many null (NaN) values in this dataset. Also notice how they are mostly in rows numbered 9466-9470. Also notice how there are null valeus also in the last columns of the data in rows 0-4 as well. This could cause issues when trying to manipulate the data later on.

Where do these null values come from in this dataset? We will discuss..
